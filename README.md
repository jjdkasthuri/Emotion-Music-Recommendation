# Emotion-Music-Recommendation
This project uses an emotion recognition model trained on the FER 2013 dataset to detect emotions from a webcam feed. Based on the detected emotion, it fetches personalized song playlists from Spotify using the Spotipy wrapper, enhancing user experience with tailored music recommendations.
